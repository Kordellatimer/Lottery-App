# Lottery App!
Created a Lottery app that allows the User to pick 3 numbers and try to match it to the random number the computer generates.

**Link to project:** https://kordellatimer.github.io/Lottery-App


## How it works:

**Tech used:** HTML, JavaScript ES6

To use this app, first you will need to clone this repository then download the folder to your desktop. Open the terminal and go to the desktop directory. Then cd (change directory) to the Lottery-App folder. In the terminal type "ls" and make sure the server.js is there. Then in the terminal, type "node server.js" to start your local server on your machine. Then go to your Web Browser and type "localhost:8080" and enjoy using the Lottery app!

## Optimizations
*(optional)*

Now that I got the functionalities working. Next step is to style it with CSS.

## Lessons Learned:

Learning how to use the terminal and how to create a simple local server that can read files. Also learned some more syntax for ES6.

## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
